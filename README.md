PERI : Parameter Extraction from Reconstruction of Images
---------------------------------------------------------

A software which implements the generalized framework of extracting parameters
(positions, radii of spheres; microscope properties) by full reconstruction of
experimental images. The general framework is built on combining components
(illumination field, background, particles) into a model which is then
optimized given data.
