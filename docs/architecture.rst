Package architecture
********************

This document is a description of the overall package architecture elucidated
via a simple example of polynomial fitting. In this example, we will have noisy
data which we wish to fit with a polynomial. While a relatively simple problem,
we will implement it in the PERI framework including how to get the best
performance using various aspects of the package.
