Welcome to PERI's documentation!
================================

Parameter Extraction from Reconstruction of Images (PERI) is a package that
extracts features from microscope images by fitting a physics-based model to
data. It is a set of models and components that are used to recreate the
physics of image formation in order to extract desired quantities such as
particle sizes and positions at the information theoretic limit.
