Wishlist for CPU/GPU interop C++ OpenCL array super class
    * continuous in memory, not dynamic in size
    * numpy things like slicing, reduction functions
    * lazy transfer to other devices to reduce mem bandwith issues
    * can compile anywhere
    * works with OpenCL / OpenMP / <none> (maybe CUDA too) seemlessly

Sketch of how that might work
